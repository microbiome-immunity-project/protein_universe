# Sequence-structure-function relationships in the microbial protein universe

This repository contains code and/or instructions for working with the data associated with our paper [_Sequence-structure-function relationships in the microbial protein universe_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.18.484903).
The `dataset_searching` directory contains scripts searching the processed data using sequence, structure, or function.
Additionally, the `notebooks` directory contains notebooks for reproducing many of the figures.

## Data
Running the dataset searching scripts will require youp to download the full dataset.
Running some of the notebooks will require some intermediate processing files.
Both the full dataset and intermediate processing files are available on Zenodo, __doi:__ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6477242

## Citing
A pre-print manuscript can be found of the BioRxiv, __doi:__ https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.18.484903
